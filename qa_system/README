Before running the system please run the file install.sh as

sh install.sh

Then follow the following steps. It requires python2.7 to run the file.

The file that has our code resides in the qa_system.zip and is named as quesAnsSys.py, unzip the file and then our program can be run as 

/usr/local/stow/python/amd64_linux26/python-2.7.3/bin/python quesAnsSys.py <input.txt>

from the unzipped folder

I am downloading stanford-corenlp-python folder because 
it is a library we are using in the project for POS Tagging and Named Entity Recognition.

This file finally produces an output response_file.txt which has the answers to our questions.

Our system also runs very slow and it take 20-30 minutes processes all question given in the developset, so depending on the size of the testiest it may take more or less time and also depending on the machine.

My email id is soumyasmruti@gmail.com and phone number 385-216-5363. If you have any problem running my code please let me know, I have invested lot of time developing it and it may take small tweaks if it doesnâ€™t run after reading this file.
